            <h2>
                McCandless Journey
            </h2>
            <p>
                Chris McCandless was a boy born in 1968. He was born into a rough household led by his cheating father. Chris was a bastard son, and it was not until he was fairly 
                old that he learned of this information. Chris, infuriated with his parents and especially his father, soon set out on an adventure. Chris McCandless soon became 
                known as Alexander Supertramp. He traveled as a hitchhiker from destination to destination with no real goals in mind. He first began his journey with his car; 
                however, when his car failed him due to a severe lack of traction, he decided to abandon his beloved car and continue on foot. Alex left behind his possessions and 
                burned his money. He carried only what he found to be essential, such as a 5-pound bag of rice. He traveled far across North America. From northern Mexico to Canada, 
                he only had one place he truly called home: Carthage. Carthage was a small town that housed a mill somewhere in it. McCandless employed there twice on different parts 
                of his adventure. He loved Carthage, but when his boss, the owner of the mill, was arrested for creating black boxes McCandless left Carthage behind him. McCandless 
                continued his journey for a long time, but when he felt that the time was right, he made his way towards Alaska. It was a dangerous journey that resulted in 
                McCandless's demise. Many call Chris reckless or foolish, and many call him brave or honorable. To hurt your family by running away is a beyond horrible thing to do.
                While this may be true, McCandless was chasing a dream of reaching Alaska and surviving in its beyond harsh conditions. To actively chase this goal earns him at 
                least a little praise; However, this attempt to survive in the wilderness did not have to be as suicidal as McCandless made it. Truth be told, McCandless was a 
                fool who thought he could master such a dangerous challenge. McCandless's tale is a tale of bravery and arrogance. To some its a fearful tale of how unforgiving 
                nature can be to those arrogant enough to challenge it, but to others its a tale of bravory and herorics that inspires people to take on this legendary challenge. 
                Whoever it may be, this tale seeks to filter out those who are sane enough to stick with humanity, and those who are brave enough to plundge deep into the wild.

            <p style="margin-right:10px;">
                This photo is of the cover of the paper back copy of Into The Wild. On this photo we see the "magic bus" in which McCandless spent his final hours starving to death. 
                After the poisonous seeds of a type of wild potato. These seeds prevent the consumer from gaining nutrients from eating. They are very deadly, yet in a desperate 
                attempt to not run out of food, Chris decided to eat the seeds. It is believed he assumed the seeds were not poisonous since the root of the plant (the potato) is not
                poisonous. This was definitely one of the biggest mistakes Chris McCandless made during this expedition. Chris spent many hours inside the bus, he used said bus as a
                sort of camp. It was kitted out with basic necessities such as a bed and a wood stove. It had these applications in case any hunter needed it as shelter. Chris made
                many other mistakes during the voyage; however, his biggest mistake is coming to such a harsh place with almost no preparation. When heading out into this great 
                unknown he forgot a map and compass. These navigational tools are some of the most important tools anyone could have for such a dangerous journey. He also failed to
                pack the necessary supplies, such as food, water, etc. Chris was not prepared, nor was he knowledgeable enough to survive or even think about surviving Alaska.

                    My Impression
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Into The Wild left a fairly strong impression on me. It is a classic story found throughout literature. A story of a brave adventurer going into a risky situation
                    that many would not dare to try. It is truly a tale as old as time, but the thing that differs from these fictions is that this story is real. Into The Wild
                    showcases the risks that nature will provide in life, but it also showcases the joy and excitement that living off the land and achieving your dream can bring.
                    I truly think that Chris McCandless was happy until the end, when his freedom closed, and instead of the happy, and social man that Chris McCandless was during
                    his trips around America, we saw a scared man separated from the rest of the world by a raging torrant impossible to cross. From an outsider's point of view,
                    we know there were many ways Chris could have escaped his demise, but to Chris he was trapped and alone. This story sways a lot. From joy-filled events to
                    dangerous situations that could have easily resulted in Chris's death, for that was part of the adventure. The life Chris chose was that of a hitchhiker who
                    tried new things, many of them shifting his entire sense of direction; however, these shifts only changed his route, for no matter what, his end goal
                    remained the same. This story was inspiring to see a person chase their dream so actively and so fearlessly that one could not help but to feel so
                    inspired. For someone so smart to know that every step they took was more dangerous than the last is truly epic.

                Preparation
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you want to take on a gauntlet like Chris McCandless did there is no reason to waste your life. Do not be as reckless as he was, instead go well prepared and make 
                sure someone will come for you if worst comes to worst. Stories have been made all over the globe of brave adventures turned to fearful escapes when those adventures
                 come ill-prepared. If you want to take on such a task first you should know what it is you want to do. Then make sure you know what challenges will befall you. Next 
                 Talk to those who know some knowledge of the challenges ahead. Finally bring all the nessessary equipment to aid you in your journey. McCandless failed on most if 
                 not all fo these steps. It is never to late to back out of this challenge. If you are to put your very being on the line you best make sure you have ever chance of 
                 sucsess. You can not turn around once you have started the challenge and it is up to your skills, and ambition to complete this task. Whether this task if a small 
                 feat laughed at buy the experienced or a grand task that make the most experienced shake it must be done with ample planning and preparation.
